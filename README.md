# 02-homework-portfolio

    Here, I've created a portfolio website with resizing elements to look appropriate on any screen size. It includes information about me, a list of deployed works, and a contact me section.

    I designed the website to be modular, including wrappers I can add to add more content later on.

    Eventually I'd like to replace the example links and image to make this a more professional project.
